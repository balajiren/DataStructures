Hash code for the index to array is hash(key)%array size
Use linked list to store key and values for handling collision
To store compute the hash code for the values by hash(key)%array_size and then map the hash code to the index in the array
To retrieve compute the hash code from the key and compute the index from hash code
If the number of collisions are very high then the hash time complexity drops to O(N) else O(1)
Can also implement hash table using balanced binary tree and guarantee O(Log(N)) and reduce space spent in creating a big array

1. Hash Map can also use Object as Key
2. Keys has to immutable so that it can get the same hash code for the object
3.
