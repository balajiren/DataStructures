1. Binary tree has N-1 edges
2. BST should have node greater than the left node and less than or equal to the the right node
    LEFT < ROOT =< RIGHT
3. Max nodes at level l is 2POWl
4. Max nodes at height h is 2POWH-1
5. Min. possible height - Log 2(N+1)-1

5. Traversals :
PreOrder : push root to stack , push right to stack, push left to stack
Inorder : recursive : root.left and then root.right
postOrder: Traverse left, right and then root
